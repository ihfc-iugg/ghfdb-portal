# Create a project

The portal allows members of the research community to document and share their work by creating projects. Whether your 
project is a future plan, currently underway, or already completed, adding it to the portal is a great way to showcase 
your contributions to the community, connect with others and give proper attribution to people and organisations that 
deserve it.

```{note}
Project creation is available to all **authenticated users**. If you haven’t created an account and signed in yet, you 
will need to do that before continuing with this tutorial. For more information on creating an account, please refer to 
the [Create an Account](create_an_account.md) tutorial.

## Step 1: Access Your Dashboard

From anywhere in the portal, open the **user menu** by clicking your profile icon in the top right corner of the site’s main navigation bar.

- In the dropdown, click **“Dashboard”**.
- This will take you to your personal dashboard.

## Step 2: Open the “Create New” Menu

You’ll now be presented with the **project creation form**. The form is straightforward and includes the following fields:

1. **Project Name** (required):  
Provide a clear and descriptive title for your project. This is how it will appear to other community members.

2. **Current Status** (required):  
Choose the most appropriate status for your project from the following options:

    - *Concept*
    - *Planning*
    - *In Progress*
    - *Complete*
    - *Unknown*

3. **Project Cover Image** (optional):  
You may upload an image that visually represents your project. This can help others better understand your work at a glance.

```{note}
Information submitted here can be edited later. If you’re unsure about the status of your project, feel free to select *Unknown*.
```

## Step 4: Save & Continue

Once you’ve completed the form, click the **"Save & Continue"** button to create your new project.

- You’ll be redirected to your new project page, where you can begin adding related datasets, collaborators, or additional context.
