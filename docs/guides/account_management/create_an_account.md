To become a part of the heatflow.world community, you'll need to create an account. This will allow you to directly contribute to the database and access other featuresthe data and resources shared by other members.

## 1. Navigate to the Sign-In Page

1. **Open the portal in a web browser**: When you visit the portal for the first time, you’ll be welcomed on the homepage.

2. **Locate the "Sign In" Button**: In the **top right corner** of the page, you’ll always find the **"Sign In"** button in the navigation bar. This button is available on every page of the portal when you are not logged in, making it easy to join our community no matter where you are on the site.

3. **Click on "Sign In"**: Click on the "Sign In" button to be taken to the sign-in page, where you can either log in as a returning community member or create a new account to start contributing.

## 2. Create a New Account

Once you click the **"Sign In"** button, you'll be taken to the sign-in page. If you're a new member of our community and haven't created an account yet, you'll need to sign up first.

1. **Locate the Sign-Up Link**: On the sign-in page, you will see a **card** in the center of the screen prompting you to log in. At the top of the card, there is a message that reads:

    **"If you have not created an account yet, then please sign up first."**

2. **Click the "Sign Up" Link**: The words **"sign up"** are a clickable link that will take you to the page where you can create your account.

3. **Continue to the Create Account Page**: By clicking the **"sign up"** link, you will be redirected to the page where you can enter your details to join the portal community.

## 3. Account Creation Page

Once you’ve clicked the **"Sign Up"** link, you'll be taken to the **account creation page**, where you can enter your personal details to join the portal and become a community member. There are two methods to create an account: using your **ORCID** account (recommended) or signing up manually. The account creation page will look similar to the following screenshot:

```{attention}
In you see the following message on the account creation page,

*"We are sorry, but the sign up is currently closed."*

it means the portal is either invite-only or not accepting new accounts at this time. If this happens, we encourage you to check back later or contact the portal administrators for more information on when new accounts will be accepted.
```

1. **Sign Up Using ORCID (Preferred)**: We recommend signing up using your **ORCID** account. This method allows us to automatically match you with relevant content already available in the portal’s database, enhancing your experience right from the start.

    - Under the heading **"Or use a third-party"**, click the **ORCID logo**.
    - You will be redirected to a **confirmation page** where you’ll need to click **"Continue"** to proceed with the ORCID authentication.
    - Follow the login flow on the ORCID website. If you don't have an ORCID account yet, you will need to create one first.
    - Once the authentication is complete, you will be redirected back to the portal, where your portal account will now be linked to your ORCID profile.

2. **Manual Sign Up (Alternative)**: If you prefer not to use ORCID, you can still sign up manually by filling out the registration form with your name, email address, and password.

3. **Email Verification**: Regardless of the sign-up method (ORCID or manual), you will need to verify your email address before your account can be activated. This is important for ensuring account security and enabling features like **account recovery**.

    - After submitting your registration, you will receive a verification email.
    - Click the verification link in the email to complete your account setup.

4. **Final Login and Access to Dashboard**: Once your email is verified, you may need to **log in again** using your new credentials (or ORCID, if that’s how you registered). After logging in, you will be automatically redirected to your **personal dashboard**, where you can begin exploring the portal in full and contributing to the community.
