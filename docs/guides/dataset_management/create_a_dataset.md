# Create a dataset

Datasets are at the heart of the portal’s mission to foster open, collaborative science. Whether your dataset is raw, processed, or simply a placeholder for future data, adding it to the portal helps support attribution, reproducibility, and discovery within the research community.

```{tip}
By **creating a dataset early**, even without the data itself, you can start recording **essential metadata** like dates, contributors, descriptions, licenses, etc. This preparation ensures that the dataset is **ready for sharing and publication** in the future. 

Making your dataset available to the community early, even before you collect the data, can spark interest and potentially **lead to new collaborations**. Other researchers may recognize areas for synergy, offer insights, or contribute data that complements your work, creating opportunities for **networking** and **joint research efforts**.
```

## Step 1: Access Your Dashboard

Begin by opening your **user menu** in the top-right corner of the portal’s main navigation bar.

- Click **“Dashboard”** to open your personal dashboard.

## Step 2: Open the “Create New” Menu

At the top of your dashboard, locate the heading labeled **“Home”**.

- To the right of this heading, click the **“Create new”** dropdown button.
- Select **“Dataset”** from the menu.

## Step 3: Fill Out the Dataset Form

<!-- ![Dataset Creation Form](/_static/tutorials/create_dataset_page.png) -->

You will now be taken to the **dataset creation form**. Fill in the following fields:

1. **Image** (optional):  
You may upload an image to visually represent your dataset (e.g., a map of site locations, graph, or logo).

2. **Project** (optional):  
If this dataset is related to a project you’ve already created, you can link it here.

3. **Name** (required):  
Provide a clear, descriptive title for the dataset. This will be the primary way other community members identify and refer to it.

4. **License** (optional but strongly recommended):  
Choose a license from a list of Creative Commons options. Adding a license clarifies how others may use your data and is critical for enabling reuse, citation, and collaboration.

5. **Visibility** (required):  
Choose whether the dataset should be:

    - **Public** – visible to all users of the portal.
    - **Private** – visible only to you (and collaborators, if any are added).


```{attention}
**No License? Limited Use**  
Datasets without a license are difficult for others to reuse or share. To support open science and community growth, please consider selecting an appropriate license.

```

## Step 4: Save Your Dataset

Once the form is complete, click the **“Create”** button to save your dataset.

- You’ll be redirected to the dataset’s detail page, where you can view, update, or add additional metadata later.
