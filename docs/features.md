:::

The portal includes a **custom-built mapping application** designed to facilitate the exploration and analysis of the latest release of the **Global Heat Flow Database**. Developed by [TUD Dresden](https://www.tu-dresden.de/), this tool is built using **VueJS** and **MapLibre**, providing an interactive and responsive user interface for visualizing geographic distributions of heat flow data. The mapping application supports a variety of features, including filtering, zooming, and interactive exploration, which are invaluable for conducting spatial analysis of heat flow data. By utilizing this mapping tool, researchers can access and analyze the most recent dataset and uncover global trends and regional variations in heat flow data.

## Community-driven

The portal places a strong emphasis on community engagement and collaboration, offering various features that allow users to interact with datasets, projects, and one another. A core part of this initiative is the ability for users to **create and manage personal accounts**. Once an account is created, users can manage their datasets, track their contributions, and showcase their work by creating a personal profile. Users can also **login with their ORCID accounts**, ensuring seamless synchronization of their data across multiple platforms.

In addition to managing personal content, users are encouraged to **follow other researchers and projects**. By following users, individuals can stay updated with their work and progress, while following projects ensures that users receive timely updates on their status. This dynamic system fosters a collaborative environment where researchers can easily engage with one another through commenting and sharing feedback on datasets and projects.

Moreover, the portal offers a powerful feature for sharing datasets and projects with the broader research community. By sharing their data, researchers contribute to the **Global Heat Flow Database** and enable others to access, utilize, and build upon their work. This encourages collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and the creation of new connections within the international heat flow research community.

## Create, share, and manage heat flow related research projects

The portal provides robust tools for researchers to **create, share, and manage their heat-flow related research projects**. Adding a project to the portal is an excellent way to increase visibility, foster collaboration, and ensure proper attribution for funding or institutional support. Researchers can add past, present, or future projects, making it easier to promote their work to a broader audience.

By showcasing research projects on the portal, users not only provide insight into their ongoing efforts but also encourage other members of the community to contribute, collaborate, and share expertise. This functionality helps increase engagement and ensures that projects are more visible within the global heat flow research community.

## Create datasets, upload and publish Data

The portal also enables researchers to **create and manage datasets** for inclusion in the Global Heat Flow Database. When adding datasets, researchers can upload their existing heat flow data and ensure it conforms to predefined **metadata standards**, which ensures consistency and improves the discoverability of the data. Contributors can manage and add personal and organizational contributors to the dataset, helping to track all parties involved in the dataset’s creation.

The portal offers support for **publishing datasets** through **GFZ Data Services**, making data publicly available for citation and archiving purposes. This process is essential for formal publication, as it ensures that datasets are preserved and can be reliably cited in future research.

Even if a dataset is still under development, the portal allows researchers to create it early, facilitating the organization of essential metadata. This early-stage dataset creation helps track progress, signals intent, and encourages collaboration within the community. By making datasets available at various stages of development, researchers can spark interest, find potential collaborators, and benefit from feedback from other members of the community.

## Access data via a friendly, modern, and intuitive user interface

The portal’s user interface is designed to be **modern**, **intuitive**, and **user-friendly**, making it easy for researchers to access and explore datasets and projects. Users can search for datasets and heat flow-related projects through organized list views, with the ability to apply powerful filters to narrow down results based on specific criteria. This makes it easier for researchers to find exactly what they need.

Additionally, the portal features **data collections**, which aggregate specific types of data into single tables, allowing users to access and explore large datasets more efficiently. These collections span multiple datasets and serve as a valuable resource for researchers seeking specific types of heat flow data. For a more detailed exploration, users can view individual projects, datasets, heat flow sites, and measurements, providing a comprehensive overview of each resource.

## API Access

For researchers who wish to integrate data into existing workflows or external systems, the portal offers a **RESTful API** that facilitates programmatic access to datasets and projects. This API enables data harvesting, making it easy to collect and process data for further analysis. Researchers can use the API to integrate heat flow data into their own tools and applications, allowing them to streamline their workflows and automate repetitive tasks.

The programmatic access provided by the API supports the integration of the portal’s data into a variety of external systems, making it easier for users to incorporate the Global Heat Flow Database into their broader research initiatives.
