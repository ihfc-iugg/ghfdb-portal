This repository hosts the codebase of the Heatflow.world portal. The portal is a web application that provides access to the Global Heat Flow Database (GHFDB). The GHFDB is a collection of heat flow measurements from around the world. The portal allows users to search, filter, and download data from the GHFDB as well as individual publications. The portal is built using the Django web framework and the official version is hosted at by GFZ Potsdam, Germany.
